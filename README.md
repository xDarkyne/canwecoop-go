# CanWe~~C~~Goop

A recreation of my [CanWeCoop][canwecoop] backend in [Go][golang].

## Description

This repository is a recreation of my [CanWeCoop][canwecoop] backend in [Go][golang]. The original backend is written with [TypeScript][typescript] using [Next.js][nextjs] [api routes][nextapi] with the help of [Next Connect][nextconnect] and [TRPC][trpc]. The goal is to recreate the backend 1:1 in order to get a better understanding of [Go][golang].

## Features

- [Steam Authentication][steam]
- [PostgreSQL][postgres] database
